#Version 1.22 24-Apr-2019
#	Fixed bug when a GPO had been linked multiple times. The script counted all the GPOs, 
#		even the duplicates. Added -Unique to the Sort.
#		If a GPO was linked ten times, the script backed up the GPO ten times and created
#		the reports ten times.

#Version 1.21 11-Apr-2019
#	If -OrganizationUnit parameter was used, the $ADDomain paramater was blanked out and
#		not available for the Zip file creation. IF $ADDomain is blank, set $ADDomain to
#		$Env:USERDNSDOMAIN
